Welcome to my personal page! I'm currently an incoming PhD student at the [Faculty of Dentistry](https://facdent.hku.hk/index.html), The University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Kai Han](https://www.kaihan.org/) at [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) and [Dr. Pearl Pei Liu](https://facdent.hku.hk/about/staff-profile.php?shortname=peiliu) at Applied Oral Sciences and Community Dental Care. Previously, I obtained my MSc degree in data science at Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, HKU, and my Bechelor of Science degree in Applied Statistics at Nanjing University of Science and Technology.

I am interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, and focus on reliable representation learning and its application on dental image processing.
